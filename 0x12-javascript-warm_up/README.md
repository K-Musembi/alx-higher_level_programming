JavaScript WarmUp

JavaScript programming is awesome. This project covers foundational JS concepts such as:
variables, if ... else, for loops, while loops, functions etc.

The project is made up of functions to perform basic tasks e.g print a message, print a square, find the second biggest element in an array etc.

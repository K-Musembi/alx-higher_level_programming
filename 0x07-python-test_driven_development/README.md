PYTHON - TEST DRIVEN DEVELOPMENT

Doctests and Unittests.

The aim of this project is to write pthon programmes and test them
using doctests and unitests. Tests Driven Development is important because
it enables creation of programs that have fewer errors and higher qaulity.

The programs tested include: a function to add two integers, a function to
divide elements of a matrix, a function to print first name and last name,
a function to print a square using '#', a function to print a text, a unittest
for a function that finds the maximum integer in a list.
